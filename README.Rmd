Turn arguments passed at the command line into objects in the current environment. Scripts become more function-like, with all inputs explicitly defined. The goalis a clear, safe, modular workflow.

You can install the development version of command from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")

```{r example, eval = FALSE}

	      trim_outliers = TRUE)
```
